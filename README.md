# My personal website

this used to be hosted using s3, and had SSL and a cloudfront CDN layer, all managed in terraform - which overall was needlessly complicated. remnants of this can be seen in the `infra` folder and in some long lived remote branches, if you care.    
  
it is now hosted via netlify (makes life easy).
